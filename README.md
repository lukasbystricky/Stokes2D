# Stokes Repository

Code to solve the Stokes equations using boundary integral equations.

## Features
* confined flows, uses Power-Miranda formulation and an FMM to rapidly compute sums
* periodic domains, uses spectral Ewald to rapidly compute infinte sums
* special quadrature for on-surface evaluation of single-layer potential as well as near-surface evaluation of single- and double-layer potentials

## Compilation instructions

In addition to this repository you will need the tool for Legendre polynomials in https://github.com/ludvigak/legtools and the fast multiplication methods in https://github.com/lukasbystricky/FastTools2D. Compilation instructions for the latter repository are provided in its README, however the following sequence has been tested on Ubuntu 16.04 with Matlab 2017a as well as on Ubuntu 18.04 with Matlab 2021a:

	## clone repositories
	git clone https://github.com/ludvigak/legtools
	git clone https://github.com/lukasbystricky/FastTools2D.git
	git clone https://github.com/lukasbystricky/Stokes2D.git

	## compile periodic spectral Ewald
	cd FastTools2D/PeriodicEwald/src/build
	cmake ..
	make

	## compile FMM if desired
	## NB: on Mac, Matlab mex requires the intel compilers
	## The makefiles will need to be edited!
	cd FastTools2D/FMM/src/StokesDLP
	make
	cd ../StokesSLP
	make

	## compile special quadrature routines
	cd ../../../Stokes2D/src/build
	cmake ..
	make
	cd ../..


Start Matlab and run `initpaths.m` to initialize the proper paths. To test the spectral Ewald and special quadrature run `demo_periodic_pouseille_flow`. With 10 panels on each wall, you should acheive around 14 digits of accuracy everywhere in the domain.  

To test the FMM, run `demo_taylor_couette.m`. With 10 panels on the outer wall and 5 panels on the inner wall you should see 12 digits of accuracy everywhere.

## To do

* check OpenMP timings
* RCIP for corner treatment
* Navier-slip boundary conditions, adjoint double-layer potential
